Instructions:

1) Begin by downloading the project archive from the repository. Once downloaded, extract the contents and place them in any location on your computer that you find convenient.

2) Launch your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and navigate to the directory where you've stored the project files.

3) Next, access the terminal within your IDE or computer system. Here, you'll set up and initialize the project by executing a series of commands:

      Start by initializing a new Node.js project using the command:
               1) npm init -y
      After initialization, install two essential packages for the project by typing:
               2) npm i express socket.io

5) After setting up the necessary packages, you can initiate the server by typing the command: node server.js into the terminal. This action will start the server, enabling it to respond to requests.

6) Once the server is up and running, you'll have the ability to access specific paths such as /json and /echo. However, if you intend to engage in chat functionalities, please navigate to the '/sse' path to initiate the chat feature.
